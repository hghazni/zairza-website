## About us
ZAIRZA, a society and a cult for CETIANS who want to be ahead in the game. Sure
we all have talent but in this this club, we put our talents through many obstacles and
we conquer them. We walk out as winners who not only read books but test theories.. sometimes we even make our own. The club is managed by its students and alumni.

ZAIRZA was founded in the year 2005 and got officially recognised in 2007, as a technical society of CET.
